Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Nick Kust, Head of Product at [Future Present Labs](https://fpl.dev), where we're building the infrastructure for the next generation of American manufacturing.

## My Background

I'm a 2025 graduate from the University of Washington with a degree in Economics. My journey to product management wasn't linear—I was born in Moscow, spent significant time in Munich, and eventually found my way to the Pacific Northwest.

This international upbringing gave me a unique perspective on global markets, cultural nuances, and the universal challenges of building great products across different contexts.

## What to Expect Here

This blog will be a mix of:

- **Product & Strategy** — Lessons from building products at the intersection of software and hardware
- **Economics** — Applying economic thinking to product decisions, market dynamics, and business strategy
- **Industry Analysis** — Insights on manufacturing, reshoring, and industrial technology
- **Cross-Cultural Business** — Observations from navigating international markets and multicultural teams
- **Building in Public** — Updates on what we're building at FPL and the product challenges we face

## Why Manufacturing?

The US is at an inflection point. After decades of offshoring, the pendulum is swinging back—but the infrastructure to support domestic manufacturing doesn't exist yet. We're building it.

From a product perspective, this is fascinating: we're not just building software, we're building the connective tissue between digital design and physical production.
